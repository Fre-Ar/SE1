# Stakeholder Analysis — Local History Documentation Site

**Project:** Local History Documentation Site  
**Course:** Software Engineering (Semester Project)  
**Team:** 5 students  
**Document Owner:** Requirements Lead  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2025-10-09

> This document defines and analyzes stakeholders for the Local History Documentation Site and translates their interests into candidate, testable requirements. It follows IEEE/SWEBOK-aligned stakeholder identification, elicitation, and traceability practices.

## 1. Stakeholder Definition and Taxonomy

**Stakeholders** are individuals, groups, or organizations that affect or are affected by the system. We classify them as:

- **Primary (Direct Users):** use the system to submit or consume content.  
- **Secondary (Indirect/Operational):** interact via integrations, operations, or support.  
- **External (Regulatory/Funding):** influence constraints (legal, budget, policy).  
- **Hidden (Operational/Maintenance):** ensure ongoing running, security, and quality.

Roles commonly include **requirement providers, validators, decision-makers, maintainers/operators, and domain experts**.

---

## 2. Stakeholder Map (Project-Specific)

### 2.1 Primary (Direct Users)
- **Local residents & diaspora** — browse stories, search by era/location; want a respectful, fast, mobile-first UI.
- **Contributors (families, amateur historians, photographers)** — submit stories/images/docs; want simple upload, clear attribution and licensing, predictable moderation.
- **Educators (teachers, students)** — classroom usage; want curated collections, timelines aligned to curricula, export/print.
- **Professional historians/archivists** — demand rigorous metadata/provenance; want controlled vocabularies, citations, and revision history.

### 2.2 Secondary (Indirect)
- **Local libraries/museums/archives** — provide/ingest collections; want import/export pipelines, rights management, attribution rules.
- **Local media & tourism offices** — promote local heritage; want embeddable widgets, stable permalinks, analytics.

### 2.3 External (Influencers/Regulators)
- **Municipality/legal/GDPR officers** — ensure compliance (consent, minors’ data, copyright).  
- **Funding bodies/donors/university administration** — track impact, reliability, and sustainability.

### 2.4 Hidden (Often Overlooked)
- **System admins/DevOps** — handle hosting, backups, monitoring, incident response.  
- **Moderators/curators** — review queues, deduplication, tagging, dispute handling.  
- **Accessibility advocates/users** — inclusive design (WCAG 2.2 AA) and authoring support.  
- **Security team** — protect PII, prevent abuse/spam, enforce least-privilege access.

| Funders/University | External | Impact, uptime, sustainability | KPI dashboard; uptime ≥ 99.5%; backup daily | Underuse; outages | Quarterly reports; demo days |
| Admins/DevOps | Hidden | Simple deploys, backups, monitoring, logs | IaC scripts; alerts; nightly backups | Operational toil; silent failures | Runbooks; observability stack |
| Moderators/Curators | Hidden | Efficient review, tagging, dispute tools | <N min review flow; audit trail; messaging | Backlogs; burnout | Queue metrics; role-based workflows |
| Accessibility Advocates | Hidden | Inclusive UX and content authoring | WCAG 2.2 AA; alt-text completeness | Non-compliant components | Accessibility linting; audits |
| Security Team | Hidden | Abuse prevention, least privilege | RBAC; rate-limits; upload scanning | Spam, PII leaks | Threat model; periodic pen tests |

## 4. Interests → Candidate Requirements (Traceable)

> Each item should later gain acceptance criteria and test cases; IDs enable traceability to use cases and validation.

**Content submission & curation**  
- **R1:** Guided submission with required metadata (title, place, date/era, theme) and optional consent/licensing.  
- **R2:** Moderation queue with approve/reject/edit, provenance tracking, and audit trail.  
- **R3:** Bulk import/export (CSV/JSON) for institutional partners.

**Discovery & exploration**  
- **R4:** Search by era/theme/location with filters and relevance ranking.  
- **R5:** Interactive **timeline** and **map** views; embeddable widgets with stable permalinks.  
- **R6:** Curated collection pages (e.g., eras, districts, themes).

**Quality & trust**  
- **R7:** Source citations and revision history; contributor attribution; moderation notes.  
- **R8:** Content flag/report and dispute resolution workflow.

**Legal & privacy**  
- **R9 (NFR):** Consent management; DSAR/takedown workflow within agreed SLA; data minimization.  
- **R10 (NFR):** PII redaction tools for images/documents where needed.  
- **R11 (NFR):** Administrative action audit logs with retention policy.

**Performance & availability**  
- **R12 (NFR):** p95 page response ≤ 2 s; uptime ≥ 99.5%; daily backups.  
- **R13 (NFR):** Accessibility conformance to WCAG 2.2 AA with measurable checks.

**Operations & security**  
- **R14 (NFR):** Role-based access (contributor/moderator/admin/partner).  
- **R15 (NFR):** Anti-spam (rate limiting/CAPTCHA), file-type/size validation, malware scan on upload.

## 5. Conflict Analysis & Mitigations

- **Open access vs. moderation burden** — *Mitigate:* staged publishing, review SLAs, community guidelines.  
- **Speed vs. accuracy** — *Mitigate:* quick publish with essential fields; progressive enrichment by archivists.  
- **Privacy/compliance vs. storytelling richness** — *Mitigate:* consent templates, default anonymization, takedown workflow.  
- **Scope creep vs. semester timeline** — *Mitigate:* MoSCoW and 100-dollar tests during workshops; MVP freeze.

2. **Model** — Use-case diagram and textual use cases with pre/post-conditions and alt flows.  
3. **Prioritize** — MoSCoW + 100-dollar test across roles; publish MVP scope.  
4. **Specify** — Convert to functional/NFR requirements with acceptance criteria.  
5. **Trace** — Maintain a lightweight matrix linking *Stakeholder → Story → Requirement → Use Case → Test Case*.  
6. **Validate** — Scenario walkthroughs and early usability tests per stakeholder group; update backlog.

## 10. Deliverable Alignment (Weeks 1–5)

- Finalize stakeholder register and engagement plan.  
- Produce first-pass user stories/use cases tied to stakeholders.  
- Publish MVP feature list with prioritization rationale.  
- Create initial traceability matrix to carry forward into design, testing, and acceptance.
